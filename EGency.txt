This application will be about handling emergency situations like medical help, theft or fire with an easier approach. It allows the emergency victim and also the people witnessing such incident to promptly make use of this application to obtain immediate help. The application allows us to locate nearest required emergency facilities like Hospital, police station or Fire station providing us with facilities such as Call (Calls the emergency facility), Navigate (Route to the emergency facility) and Ping (Sends the location to the database which the emergency facilities can have access to for dispatching immediate help). 
Emergency facilities will have their version of the application installed natively on devices inside their facilities or vehicles where each emergency request will be queued and they can choose which ones to attend to. As the user app is location aware, so will be the facility app. The source of each request will be pinned on the map of the facility app so that it becomes easier for them to attend to the situation.
