This application will be about handling emergency situations like medical help, theft, blood requirements or fire with an easier approach. It allows the emergency victim and also the people witnessing such incident to promptly make use of this application to obtain immediate help. The application allows us to locate nearest required emergency facilities like Hospital, Police station, Fire station or Blood banks providing us with facilities such as Call (Calls the emergency facility), Navigate (Route to the emergency facility) and Ping (Sends the location to the database which the emergency facilities can have access to for dispatching immediate help). 
Emergency facilities will have their version of the application installed natively on devices inside their facilities or vehicles where each emergency request will be queued and they can choose which ones to attend to. As the user app is location aware, so will be the facility app. The source of each request will be pinned on the map of the facility app so that it becomes easier for them to attend to the situation giving them the fastest route to reach the emergency.
The user will have an application on their side and they will be required to login once for authentication purposes. Their name, address, emergency contact numbers and blood group will be required for this which will be also useful during the emergency. On the other hand, the emergency unit facilities wont have the same application but will have a specfic client application with them. This application wont be available to the users and will be installed directly with the emergency facility.
The user will be able to contact the emergency service with just a couple of clicks or even by a smart emergency gesture of pressing the volume down button three times. This will by default send a ping to the police for emergency.
